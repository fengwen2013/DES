********************************
GENERAL INFORMATION
********************************
STRUCTURE:
--------------------------------
hw5.c    	 : Handle commands and invoke corresponding functions.
hw5.h    	 : Include all header files and function declarations.
tablecheck.c : Deal with tablecheck command.
crypt.c 	 : Deal with encrypt, decrypt, encrypt3 and decrypt3 command.
util.c  	 : Provides basic functionalities used by almost all programs.
makefile	 : Complie the program.


RUNING ENVIRONMNET: 
--------------------------------
Linux, Unix


HOW TO COMPILE:
--------------------------------
Makefile is included, simply enters:
    make hw5(or make)
an executable named hw4 is created.

GUIDELINE
********************************
THE COMMANDLINE SYNTAX:
--------------------------------
    hw5 tablecheck -t=tablefile
    hw5 encrypt -k=key -t=tablefile [file]
    hw5 decrypt -k=key -t=tablefile [file]
    hw5 encrypt3 -k=key3 -t=tablefile [file]
    hw5 decrypt3 -k=key3 -t=tablefile [file]


THE MEANING of THE COMMANDLINES:
--------------------------------
tablecheck:  	Check the integrity of tablefile.
 
encrypt	  :  	Encrypts the input using DES driven by tablefile in the ECB mode using key as the encryption key (8-byte long and in hexstring format). If the filesize of the input is not a multiple of 8 bytes, please pad it with zeroes.
 
decrypt	  :  	Decrypts the input using DES driven by tablefile in the ECB mode using key as the encryption key (8-byte long and in hexstring format). If the filesize of the input is not a multiple of 8 bytes, please pad it with zeroes.
 
encrypt3  :  	Encrypts the input using EDE triple DES driven by tablefile in the ECB mode using key3 as the encryption key (24-byte long and in hexstring format). If the filesize of the input is not a multiple of 8 bytes, please pad it with zeroes.
 
decrypt3  :  	Decrypts the input using EDE triple DES driven by tablefile in the ECB mode using key3 as the encryption key (24-byte long and in hexstring format). If the filesize of the input is not a multiple of 8 bytes, please pad it with zeroes.


THE OUTPUT FOR THE COMMANDLINES:
--------------------------------
tablecheck:  	 The command should produce no output in stdout. All error output must go to stderr.
 
encrypt	  :  	 The output of this command is a binary file where each 8-byte block is a direct DES encryption of the corresponding input 8-byte block.The format of output is as follows:

    (C0,D0)=...
    (C1,D1)=...
    k1=...
    (C2,D2)=...
    k2=...
    ...
    (C16,D16)=...
    k16=...
    (L0,R0)=...
    (L1,R1)=...
    ...
    (L16,R16)=...
    
The values of the C's, D's, L's, R's, and subkeys should be printed in hexstring format. Please only output the L's and R's values during encryption of the first 8-byte block.
Using the palindromic (and anti-palidromic) definition, if key is a weak or a semi-weak key, please print an error message and only the subkeys.

decrypt	  :  	 The output of this command is a binary file where each 8-byte block is a direct DES decryption of the corresponding input 8-byte block. If the original (binary) plaintext filesize is not a multiple of 8 bytes, the output of the decrypt command will not be the same as the plaintext file.The format of output is as follows:

    (C0,D0)=...
    (C1,D1)=...
    k1=...
    (C2,D2)=...
    k2=...
    ...
    (C16,D16)=...
    k16=...
    (L0,R0)=...
    (L1,R1)=...
    ...
    (L16,R16)=...
    
The values of the C's, D's, L's, R's, and subkeys should be printed in hexstring format. Please only output the L's and R's values during decryption of the first 8-byte block.
Using the palindromic (and anti-palidromic) definition, if key is a weak or a semi-weak key, please print an error message and only the subkeys.

encrypt3  :  	 The output of this command is a binary file where each 8-byte block is a direct 3DES encryption of the corresponding input 8-byte block. If one of the keys in key3 is a weak or a semi-weak key, please just print an error message.
 
decrypt3  :  	 The output of this command is a binary file where each 8-byte block is a direct 3DES decryption of the corresponding input 8-byte block. If the original (binary) plaintext filesize is not a multiple of 8 bytes, the output of the decrypt command will not be the same as the plaintext file. If one of the keys in key3 is a weak or a semi-weak key, please just print an error message.
